            If your prompts are not visible, they may still be stored in the old
            local storage. Visit our GitHub page, download the ZIP file, and add
            it to your browser extensions, then temporarily disable this
            extension. In the popup window, go to settings and export your
            prompts. Save them securely, then re-enable the main extension and
            disable the one you just installed. If prompts are still not
            visible, go to settings in the main extension, import the saved
            prompts, and it should work again. You will find a more detailed
            explanation to that issue here (in German):

            Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a trend — it’s becoming
            the backbone of modern IT and productivity. But with its growing
            presence, one truth is becoming clear: **AI is only as good as the
            prompts we feed it.** Too often, we see people entering the same
            vague, repetitive prompts and expecting magical results. This not
            only reduces efficiency — it defeats the entire purpose of using AI
            in the first place. Every inaccurate or unclear prompt forces the AI
            to work harder, producing mediocre results that require more
            back-and-forth correction. This wastes your time, drains computing
            power, and yes — increases energy consumption. In an age where
            sustainability matters, this inefficiency carries a real
            environmental cost. That’s why we built **our own Prompt Management
            System** — not just another tool, but a purpose-driven platform
            designed from the ground up to make AI interaction smarter, faster,
            and truly efficient. ---

            <h2>Why Existing Tools Fell Short</h2>
            We’ve tested countless tools on the market: browser extensions,
            clunky software that needs to be installed, systems demanding your
            API keys and storing them insecurely. Some simply store prompts with
            no structure. Others require constant copy-pasting and offer no real
            guidance or improvement over time. That’s not smart. That’s not
            scalable. And that’s not the future. Prompt engineering is evolving
            — and existing tools are stuck in the past. ---

            <h2>Our Mission: Smarter Prompts, Smarter Future</h2>
            We believe in a different vision:
            <strong>A tool that adapts with you.</strong> One that helps you
            craft smarter, cleaner prompts.
            <strong>
              One that learns what works — and what doesn’t — to reduce the
              trial-and-error chaos.
            </strong>
            A system built to not only boost your productivity, but also
            minimize wasted resources and support a more eco-friendly AI
            ecosystem. We're not just building a tool. We're creating a
            <strong>movement</strong> — toward automation, toward precision, and
            toward a world where AI can begin to self-improve without constant
            human intervention. If you believe in the power of AI, if you care
            about using it responsibly, and if you want to be part of shaping
            its future — then this is for you. ---

            <h2>Join Us</h2>
            This is just the beginning. We’re designing the foundations for an
            intelligent, automated, and deeply human-centric AI experience — and
            we want you to be part of it. If you’ve ever been frustrated by
            current prompt tools, or if you believe AI should be both powerful
            *and* sustainable, then it’s time to upgrade. Let’s stop wasting
            time — and start building smarter. Together. We don't want to sell
            you something like everyone else does. What we tell you is the
            truth; otherwise, you wouldn't be reading this or using our tool.

            Our tool is designed so that folders can also be saved in it. These
            folders can be used as project folders. The prompts can be saved in
            one folder per project. This allows you to keep track of how you
            have implemented a certain feature with AI in a project that you may
            want to reuse for another project.

            Your prompts are stored locally in your browser via Chrome Storage
            Local. This means that no data is transferred to external servers,
            so your prompts remain exclusively on your device. Full control:
            Only you (or your browser profile) can access your stored data. Your
            data is automatically protected by the browser. Chrome protects your
            locally stored data using its own security mechanisms, such as
            isolated browser processes and user rights. There is no risk from
            API keys or online accounts because PromptIn requires no login,
            account, or cloud synchronization. Conclusion: Your data is as
            secure as your device itself. As long as your computer or browser
            profile is protected, your prompts are protected too — completely
            offline and without third-party access.
